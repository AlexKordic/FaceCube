facecube.py allows you to capture whatever your Kinect is pointing at as a
point cloud to be formed into a solid STL in MeshLab.  Specific objects can
be thresholded, segmented out, and hole filled.
Usage: python facecube.py filename
 
Up/Down      Adjusts the depth of the threshold closer or deeper
             (can still be used while paused)
Spacebar     Pauses or unpauses capture
Mouse Click  Click on an object to choose it and hide everything else.
             Click elsewhere to clear the selection.
H/G          After choosing an object, H increases hole filling, G decreases
D            Toggles donut mode. Defaults to off.  Turn on if the object
             should have holes going through it.
S            Saves the currently chosen object as a filename.ply
P            Saves a screenshot as filename.png

meshing.mlx is a MeshLab filter script to turn the point cloud into a solid 
STL.
